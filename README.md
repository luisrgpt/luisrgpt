Hi there! Thanks for reading this ðŸ‘‹

My name is LuÃ­s, and I'm currently working and learning on backend applications, integrated with DevOps tools to optimize productivity and quality of software.

For any DevOps or GitOps tasks, you may find me here, and I'll gladly do my best in finding the most suitable way to automatize what was before a monkey's job :computer: :monkey:
